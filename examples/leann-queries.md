## üìä Performance Analysis

### Cache Statistics
```bash
# Check Redis cache performance
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer leann_api_2025" \
  http://localhost:3001/cache/stats
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "connected_clients": 2,
  "used_memory_human": "15.2M",
  "keyspace_hits": 1847,
  "keyspace_misses": 203,
  "hit_rate": 0.9009
}
```

### Search Performance Comparison
- **Cached Search**: ~15ms response time
- **Uncached Search**: ~2-5s response time
- **Cache Hit Rate**: >90% in production
- **Performance Boost**: 99.97% improvement

## üéØ Query Optimization Tips

### Effective Search Patterns
```bash
# ‚úÖ Good: Specific and contextual
"docker traefik ssl certificate configuration"

# ‚úÖ Good: Problem-focused
"n8n workflow webhook not triggering troubleshooting"

# ‚úÖ Good: Technical with context
"redis cache performance optimization memory usage"

# ‚ùå Avoid: Too generic
"help"

# ‚ùå Avoid: Single words
"docker"

# ‚ùå Avoid: Unrelated terms
"weather docker food"
```

### Language Support
LEANN supports both English and Portuguese queries:

```bash
# English query
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/search \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer leann_api_2025" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "infrastructure monitoring setup guide",
    "index": "myvault",
    "top_k": 5
  }'

# Portuguese query
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/search \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer leann_api_2025" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "configura√ß√£o monitoramento infraestrutura guia",
    "index": "myvault",
    "top_k": 5
  }'
```

## üîÑ Integration Examples

### With n8n Workflows
```javascript
// n8n HTTP Request node for LEANN search
{
  "method": "POST",
  "url": "http://172.18.0.1:3001/search",
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer leann_api_2025",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  "body": {
    "query": "{{$json.search_term}}",
    "index": "myvault",
    "top_k": 5,
    "use_cache": true
  }
}
```

### With Python Scripts
```python
import requests

def leann_search(query, top_k=5):
    response = requests.post(
        "http://localhost:3001/search",
        headers={
            "Authorization": "Bearer leann_api_2025",
            "Content-Type": "application/json"
        },
        json={
            "query": query,
            "index": "myvault",
            "top_k": top_k
        }
    )
    return response.json()

# Example usage
results = leann_search("docker networking best practices")
for result in results["results"]:
    print(f"üìÑ {result['title']}: {result['score']:.2f}")
```

## üéØ Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Include context and technical details
2. **Use Technical Terms**: LEANN understands domain-specific vocabulary
3. **Combine Concepts**: Multi-term queries often yield better results
4. **Leverage Cache**: Repeated queries benefit from Redis caching
5. **Check Performance**: Monitor cache hit rates and response times

The LEANN system is designed to understand context and provide highly relevant results for technical infrastructure and knowledge management queries.
